# Face Recognition with FaceNet
This repository contains a TensorFlow 2 implementation of face recognition with [FaceNet (CVPR '15)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Schroff_FaceNet_A_Unified_2015_CVPR_paper.html).

The content here is from a programming assignment in the [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/programs/learning-program-qth60/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) course by Coursera.
